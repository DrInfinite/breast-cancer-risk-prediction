## Using Predictive Analytics model to diagnose Breast Cancer.
---

### Objective:
The repository is a demonstration on how to:
* Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset
* Evaluate and interpret my results and justify my interpretation based on observed data set
* Create notebooks that serve as computational records and document my thought process. 

The analysis is divided into four sections, saved in juypter notebooks in this repository
1. Identifying the problem  and Data Sources
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Pre-Processing the Data
4. Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is  malignant or Benign

### [Notebook 1](): Identifying the problem and Getting data.
**Notebook goal:Identify the types of information contained in our data set**
In this notebook, Python modules are used to import external data sets in order to get to know/familiarize oneself with the data and think about how to manage the data in various ways.
### [Notebook 2]() Exploratory Data Analysis
**Notebook goal:  Explore the variables to assess how they relate to the response variable** 
In this notebook, we learn about data exploration and visualisation approaches using Python libraries (Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn). Data familiarity is vital since it will give relevant knowledge for data pre-processing).
### [Notebook 3]() Pre-Processing the data
**Notebook goal:Find the most predictive features of the data and filter it so it will enhance the predictive power of the analytics model.**
In this notebook, we utilise feature selection to minimise high-dimensional data, as well as feature extraction and modification to reduce dimensionality. This is critical in preprocessing the data before developing predictive models.
### [Notebook 4]() Predictive model using Support Vector Machine (svm)
**Notebook goal: Construct predictive models to predict the diagnosis of a breast tumor.** 
In this notebook, we build a predictive model to predict the diagnosis of a breast tumour using the SVM machine learning technique. Breast tumour diagnosis is a binary variable (benign or malignant). We also test and interpret the fitted model using the confusion matrix and receiver operating curves (ROC).

### [Notebook 5](): Optimizing the  Support Vector Classifier
**Notebook goal: Construct predictive models to predict the diagnosis of a breast tumor.** 
In this notebook, we will use scikit-learn to modify the parameters of the SVM Classification model.
